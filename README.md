#### Now, some facts about me:
- I created my first functional website when I was just 13
- I learnt Python at the age of 14, only to create my own Jarvis after watching Iron Man (lmao)
- I'm currently pursuing a dual degree (IIT Madras- BS in Data Science and Applications & Symbiosis University- B.Tech. in CSIT)
- I'm exploring research papers about Brain-Machine Interfaces, something that seems astonishing and futuristic to me

### What I work on now?
- I am currently exploring how to automate tasks by creating workflows and AI agents using n8n and other stunning tools
- I am passionate about Web development, so after creating some stunning UI using modular JS, I am currently sharpening my skills in React.js
- I am sharpening my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems concepts, Machine Learning Foundations, and Modern App Development
- I am working on a lot of projects, which you can check out on my GitHub profile or go to:
